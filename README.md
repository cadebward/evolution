# Evolution

A friend of mine and I were talking one day about building a game. We thought it'd be fun to go back and forth; he'd design a bit, then I'd code a bit, etc. Here's the start of that game. Let's see how it _evolves_ ;)

To run the game, install node, `npm install`, `npm start`, then navigate to http://localhost:3000

We'll make a nice script to help deployment along but for now: clone this repo into a different folder and checkout the gh-pages branch. Then all you need to do is run webpack, copy over the built files to the gh-pages folder, and deploy to gh-pages from there.

Music comes from [incompetech's Ossuary collection](http://incompetech.com/music/royalty-free/index.html?collection=006). It's awesome. If we need any more music we should look there first. We just need to make sure to put a credits page in the game and attribute correctly.
